# Working with Jupyter/IPython notebooks on your computer

By following the links in **Readme** you can view these notebooks from their source on the internet, but if you want to run the code in them 


    You should still have a Python folder called Python in your Documents folder. If you haven't create one now. Create a subfolder called IPython, open it and save the attached .ipynb files in it.

    Click on the Start Button (the Windows logo on the far left of the toolbar). Go to All Programs -> Programming Languages -> Anaconda 2.3 (64-bit).

    There will normally be three versions of IPython called  IPython (Py 2.7), IPython (Py 2.7) Notebook and IPython (Py 2.7) QTConsole. Don't open any of them! Instead, right-click on IPython (Py 2.7) Notebook and select 'copy'.

    Go back to your IPython folder, right-click and select 'paste'.

    Double-click on the icon you've just created. If everything's working a window should open (you won't need to use this one), and then a tab should open in Internet Explorer. It should say 'jupyter' at the top. The files you saved in your IPython directory will be listed on this screen.

    Click on First.ipnyb. A new tab should open in your browser. Read the content and follow the instructions.
