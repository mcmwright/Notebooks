    "# Animation\n",
    "We've used Python (and NumPy and Matplotlib) to plot some of the functions we frequently encounter in acoustics, and this has helped us to explore how their appearance depends on parameters such as wavenumber. But acoustics is a branch of dynamics, which means that things move continuously with time: oscillators oscillate, modes vibrate, waves propagate. It's often useful to see that motion so in this notebook we're going to look at ways to animate plots of functions. Naturally we'll need to import some packages to do so."
