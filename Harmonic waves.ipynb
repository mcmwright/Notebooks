    "2. The argument `cmap = cm.coolwarm` that we passed to `pcolormesh()` specifies the colour map, i.e. how to translate values of $p$ into colours. The `coolwarm` colour map is particularly useful for wavefields because it allows the viewer to distinguish between positive and negative acoustic pressure - it's similar to the 'wave' colour map in COMSOL. \n",
