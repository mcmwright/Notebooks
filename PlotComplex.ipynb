    "The function $e^{i(\\omega t - kx)}$ and its factors $e^{i\\omega t}$ and $e^{-ikx}$ occur very often in acoustics, usually when we're considering single-frequency solutions of linear problems. Of course, all the physical quantities in acoustics are wholly real, but that doesn't mean we can just ignore the imaginary part when calculating solutions. In this section we'll try to build up a picture of what the function $f(x) = e^{-ikx}$ looks like."
