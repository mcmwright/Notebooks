# Notebooks
This repository contains some of the IPython notebooks I use for teaching.

I suggest working through them in this order:

1. [First](First.ipynb)
2. [Python](Python.ipynb)

Here's a link to a notebook with some maths in it: [2D plotting](Plot2D.ipynb)

Here's the same link via nbviewer: [2D plotting](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/mcmwright/Notebooks/blob/master/Plot2D.ipynb)
