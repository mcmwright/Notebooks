# Notebooks
### Matthew Wright
This repository contains some of the Jupyter notebooks I use for teaching. The links below will let you view them; for instructions on how to run them see below.

I suggest working through them in this order:

1. **First** to learn about the notebook interface.
2. **Python** for a reminder of Python.
3. **NumPy** for a brief introduction to Numpy.
4. **Plot 2D** to explain how to evaluate and plot functions of two variables.
5. **Control waves 1** to get started with waves.
6. **Harmonic waves** to extend the concepts.

## Working with Jupyter/IPython notebooks on your computer

By following the links above you can view these notebooks from their source on the internet, but if you want to run the code in them you'll need to have Jupyter/IPython installed on your computer and you'll need local copies of the notebooks. These instructions tell you how to do both on a UDE PC at the University of Southampton.

Jupyter is the new name for IPython, chosen to reflect the fact that it can work with multiple languages, notably JUlia, PYthon and R. 

### Installing Jupyter

If you've got Anaconda installed on your computer you've already got it. If you haven't then install it from the Additional Software link on your desktop.

### Copying the notebook files.

Create a folder on your PC somewhere in your My Documents folder. 

Click on the green button above that says **Clone or Download** and then select **Download ZIP**, and save the contents of the resulting zip folder in your new folder. You can achieve the same effect by right-clicking on the filenames above (e.g. `First.ipynb`) and selecting 'save file as', it's just a bit more laborious because you have to do it one at a time.
